# ROB301-Intro-To-Robotics
Labs for ROB301 Introduction to Robotics (Sep. - Nov. 2019)
## [Lab 1: Sensor & Actuator Programming](https://github.com/zhouyuq6/ROB301-Intro-To-Robotics/tree/master/1.Sensor%20%26%20Actuator%20Programming)
Write a simple Python ROS node, upload to the Waffle Pi, acquire data from the sensors and drive the actuators.
## [Lab 2: Pose-to-Pose Control of a Robot](https://github.com/zhouyuq6/ROB301-Intro-To-Robotics/tree/master/2.Pose-to-Pose%20Control%20of%20a%20Robot)
Apply pose-to-pose control to move robot in straight-line path, straight-line segments and curved path.
## [Lab 3: Path Following Robot](https://github.com/zhouyuq6/ROB301-Intro-To-Robotics/tree/master/3.Path-Following%20Robot)
Implement a PID controller to execute path following and run a closed-circuit race course.
## [Lab 4: Kalman Filtering](https://github.com/zhouyuq6/ROB301-Intro-To-Robotics/tree/master/4.Kalman%20Filtering)
Implement an extended Kalman filter for 1D localization.
## [Final Project](https://github.com/zhouyuq6/ROB301-Intro-To-Robotics/tree/master/5.Final%20Design%20Project)
This project aims to control a Turtlebot 3 Waffe Pi robot to simulate a mail delivery route in the lab
environment. The robot loops along a track and delivers to 12 different offces, which are represented by four different colour patches (blue, orange, yellow and green) along the track. The robot use a camera mounted at the front to recognized these colour patches. A topological map of all offces is also given to the robot before hand as shown below. The robot is required to perform a 'delivering motion' at desired offces.
